# ChessScoreboard

**ChessScoreboard** is a super simple scoreboard application built for **Windows x64**.  
I created it purely to help track my wins/loss/draw score while recording videos for my youtube chess series, and I don’t have any plans to add new features or expand it beyond its current state. I really don't know why anyone else would ever need this to be honest.

A prebuilt release is available [here.](https://github.com/case-presley/chessscoreboard/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

---

## Features
- Simple Wins / Losses / Draws with + and - buttons to tally score
- Save progress to a `scores.txt` file located in the same folder as the `.exe`  

---

## Requirements
- **Windows x64**

---

## Notes
Clicking the save button will automatically create or update a `scores.txt` file next to the executable. This file stores the current time so the scoreboard can pick up where it left off next time you open it.
